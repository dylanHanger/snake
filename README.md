# Snake
My 2018 Analysis of Algorithms project

For the project we had to create an AI that would play a multiplayer game of snake (like if TRON and Snake had a baby). Every student in the course would then get marked based on the performance of their snake, my snake came third.

It's poorly laid out and a mess of files. I rewrote it a couple times and there are some left over things from the previous attempts.
I also had a bunch of issues with losing my work when switching to Wits lab computers. This is as it was in its final state
