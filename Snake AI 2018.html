                The interactive Snake competition is an AI programming challenge
                currently open only to Wits students or staff members.
                The task is simple: write a program to play a multiplayer version
                of the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)">Snake</a>.
                The goal? Eat enough apples to become the longest snake on the board.
                But don't forget about the other players. You'll want to stop them doing 
                the same thing. <strong>By any means necessary.</strong>

            <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>

            <p>                        
                Here's how it all works. At any point in time, there is a single apple on the board. Eating 
                the apple causes your snake to grow by a certain length. There are three 
                main actors in the game: snakes, apples, and power apples.
                Let's look at the mechanics of each in turn.                        
            </p>



            <h3>Snakes</h3>

            <p>
                Snakes move in one of the four cardinal directions at a speed of one square per timestep,
                with all moves executed simultaneously. A snake 
                dies when it collides with any of the grid's sides, or moves into a non-empty and non-apple square.
                If a snake collides with the body of another snake, the latter is credited with a kill. In the event of a head-on 
                collision between two snakes, both snakes are killed, but neither is credited with a kill. 
                When a snake dies, it will miss the next timestep, and be respawned on the following step
                at a random location on the board.
                Note that if your program has crashed, your snake will be removed from the board 
                for the duration of the round.
            </p>

            <h3>Apples</h3>

            <p>
                There is a single apple on the board at all times during the game.
                It appears at a random location at the beginning of the game, and
                immediately respawns at a random location every time it is eaten. 

                Eating an apple causes a snake to grow for the next few rounds by having its tail remain 
                in its current position. If multiple snakes consume the same apple at the same time,
                both snakes are killed and the apple is respawned at a new location.
                Additionally, the apple  will be respawned if it hasn't been eaten within a certain number of moves.

                Unfortunately, we purchased the apples from a farm that doesn't use preservatives. As a result, 
                the apple <em>decays</em> over time, becoming worse and worse. Initially, eating the apple is worth 
                5 points. However, the value of the apple decreases by 0.1 every timestep (rounded up to the nearest
                integer). When the apple's value is negative, eating it will cause the snake to <em>shrink</em>!
                Additionally, once the value of the apple worth -6 or less, eating it will immediately kill the snake
                doing so! So be careful!!
            </p>

        <h2>Interacting with the Game</h2>

        <p>                        
            Now that we've explained how the game works, let's look at how your agent will actually play the game.
            Your agent interacts with the game through its standard I/O mechanisms.
            This means that at every step, your agent will read in the current state of the game, and
            make its move by printing to standard output.  
        </p>

        <h3>Initialisation</h3>
        <p>
            When the game first starts, each agent is sent an 
            initialisation string which specifies the number of snakes in the game, the width and height of the
            board, and the type of game being played (mode). For these purposes, you can assume that the number of snakes
            is always 4, the width and height 50, and the mode 1. The initial input thus looks like this:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-css">4 50 50 1</code></pre>


        <h3>Game-State Updates</h3>
        <p>
            At each step in the game, a game-state  string is generated and sent to all agents, which can then be
            read in via standard input. Coordinates are such that (0,0) represents the top left square of the board.
            Each state takes the following form:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-css">
x- and y-coordinates of the apple
your snake number (an integer from 0 to 3)
description of snake 0
description of snake 1
description of snake 2
description of snake 3

</code></pre>

        <p> Each snake is described in the following format:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-css">alive/dead length kills headX,headY bodyX,bodyY bodyX,bodyY ... tailX,tailY</code></pre>

        <p>
            To better describe what's going on here, let's look at a concrete example. Imagine that we receive the following game-state:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-css">
8 16
0
alive 26 2 10,12 15,12 15,7 5,7 5,2
dead 6 6 14,13 19,13
alive 2 1 12,13 12,14
invisible 17 1 9 21,14 21,14 15,14 15,13
</code></pre>

        <p>
            In this state, the apple is at (8,16).
        </p>
        <p>
            The next line gives the index of our snake. In this case, we're snake 0, so we're the first one in the next four lines.
            If we were the last snake, we'd get an index of 3.
            The next four lines describe each snake in the game. The first word of each line is either "alive", "dead" or "invisible".
            Dead snakes are not displayed on the game board, and so they should be ignored.
            Next comes the snake's current length, followed by the number of other snakes it has killed.
        </p><p>

        </p><p>
            What follows is the snake's coordinate chain. The coordinate chain is made up of (x,y) coordinates
            representing points of interest in the snake's body. The first coordinate is the snake's head,
            the next represents the first kink in the snake. There can be any number of kinks in the snake, all of
            which are all listed in order. Finally, the last coordinate represents the tail of the snake. 
            As an example, the 3rd snake has the following description:
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly the snake's coordinate chain is given. 
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-css">alive 2 1 12,13 12,14</code></pre>
        <p>
            This snake is alive, has length 2, and 1 kill. Its head is at position (12, 13) and its tail is at (12, 14). From this we can deduce that the snake is traveling upwards, since the y-coordinate of its head is less than its tail's.
        </p>

        <h3>Making a Move</h3>

        <p>
            Once the game-state has been read in, your agent should use that information 
            to decide on its next move. A move is made simply by printing out an integer in the range 0-6.
            The available moves are as follows:
        </p>
        <div class="table-wrapper">
            <table>

                <tbody>

                    <tr>
                        <td><samp>0</samp></td>
                        <td>Up (relative to the play area - north)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><samp>1</samp></td>
                        <td>Down (relative to the play area - south)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><samp>2</samp></td>
                        <td>Left (relative to the play area - west)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><samp>3</samp></td>
                        <td>Right (relative to the play area - east)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><samp>4</samp></td>
                        <td>Left (relative to the head of your snake)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><samp>5</samp></td>
                        <td>Straight (relative to the head of your snake)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><samp>6</samp></td>
                        <td>Right (relative to the head of your snake)</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>Note that if you output a move that is opposite to the direction
                you're currently headed, you will simply continue straight. </p>


            <h3>Logging</h3>

            <p>
                In order to enable some form of logging, the game creates two files per agent, located
                in the same directory as your program. This is especially useful for Python or C++ agents, as they
                have no other method of debugging. The first file is an error file which 
                logs all runtime errors triggered by the code, while the second is a log file which allows your program 
                to save output. To write to the log file, simply prepend the word <samp>"log"</samp> <strong>and a space</strong> to your print statements.
                For example, if you output the string <samp>"log message"<samp>,  <samp>"message"</samp> will be appended to
                        the end of the log file. Anything beginning with <samp>"log "</samp> will not be treated as a game move.

                        </samp></samp></p>

                        <h3>Game Over</h3>

                        <p>When the game has been concluded, instead of a normal game-state, 
                            a single line containing the words "Game Over" will be sent to each agent. 
                            This gives you the opportunity to do some last minute cleanup, saving data to files, etc.
                            before you are shut down. If you do not exit after 500 milliseconds, you will be forcibly shut down.</p>

                                                            <h3>Testing</h3>
                                                            
                                                            <p>Aside from debugging your snake using a debugger (if you're writing a Java snake), you can also create test cases for your snake. 
                                                                The best way to do this is to the the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Gorthaur/snakevisualiser/wiki/Home">SnakeVisualiser</a> tool.
                                                                Instructions for using the tool can be found on its wiki. This is highly recommended and will save you lots of time. The idea is simple. 
                                                                Save your games, go through them to find all the times your snake did the wrong thing, create a test for the game state where it did the wrong thing, debug your code, 
                                                                and then finally leave your test there so that it can be reused and you don't break your snake when you make changes.</p>-->

                            <h2>Scoring</h2>

                            <p>
                                Throughout each game, the longest length achieved by each snake is recorded.
                                Snakes are ranked based on their longest length, with ties broken
                                by kill count. If the number of kills is also equal, then the snake with the higher index
                                takes the win.                  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As there will be many agents competing, players are organised into divisions, with each division
                                consisting of 4 agents. In the event that the lowest division does not have enough players, it will
                                be populated with built-in agents. All divisions play a single game in parallel, and the agents in 
                                each are ranked as above. Players who finish first in their division are promoted to a higher division,
                                whilst players who finish last are relegated to a lower one.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                The points table provides a weighted average score of each player over all divisions.

                                <h2>Creating a Java Agent</h2>

                                <p>                        
                                    If you're writing your agent in Java, you're in luck. We've made it extremely
                                    easy to integrate your agent into the game server from your IDE. This gives you the ability
                                    to debug your code, and allows you to quickly iterate on designs.
                                </p>

                                <p>                        
                                    First download the library from our <a href="http://snake.ms.wits.ac.za/download.php">downloads</a> page. Then 
                                    create a new Java project in your IDE of choice. Under the project's properties, 
                                    find a setting for libraries, and add the JAR you just downloaded as a compile-time library.
                                    Still in the properties, find the option that specifies the arguments that are passed to
                                    the program's main method. Add the following entry to the arguments: <code class="language-java" style="white-space: nowrap">-develop</code>.
                                    <strong>Note that this must always be the first entry in the arguments</strong>.
                                    You can also add arguments as described by the Downloads page <a href="http://snake.ms.wits.ac.za/download.php#running">here</a>.
                                    Here's a screenshot of what it would look like in NetBeans:                        
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Now you're ready to create your agent. Simply have your class
                                    inherit from <var>DevelopmentAgent</var>. Your class must override the
                                    <var>run()</var> method, which is where you'll put your agent logic.
                                    To illustrate, here's a sample agent that makes random moves: 
                                </p>

                                    Create your agent and compile it, creating an executable. Attach it to the <a href="http://snake.ms.wits.ac.za/download.php">downloaded JAR file</a> by
