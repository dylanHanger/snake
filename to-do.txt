Snake To-Do List:

    1) Optimize Pathfinding:
        a) Design new algorithm
        b) Try find actual info on D*
        c) Implement my own improvements on A*:
            - A* Replanning, functionally equivalent to D*, should be easier to add onto current codebase
                Works as follows; Generate a path using A*. Walk along that path, if we find the path we gucci. If we detect a discrepency, update the map and recalculate a path.
                This means I need to store the explored nodes explictly, as well as store the whole path. Maybe this calls for a pathfinding class which contains the algorithms and graph

    2) Fix priorities. Moves should not default to the "first safe/legal move" and rather to the next best move.

    3) Explore state-machine type agent

    4) Explore machine learning (interest)
